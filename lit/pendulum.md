This demo shows an interactive model of the chaotic double pendulum, written in PureScript, using Pandoc and Entangled to create the static web page. The entire demo runs in your web browser, so unlike with Python or R no special server is needed, just host from Github pages! Since PureScript is not the most well known programming language, I will explain some details about the use of PureScript in a bit more detail. You can recognize these by their blue shade.

::: {.alert .alert-info}
PureScript is a strongly typed functional language similar to Haskell that compiles to JavaScript. It has a highly formal approach to data types that matches really well with the topic of modelling dynamic systems.

Other than that, I have been able to build this demo without great knowledge of JavaScript.
:::

I understand the danger of explaining two difficult things at once. Non-linear dynamics is a difficult topic and PureScript is a language with high levels of abstraction. I'm hoping you can cherry pick from this demo whatever you're trying to learn.

## Why we care

I've heard some rumours that people really like Jupyter notebooks and MyBinder. Rightly so! You can show your work to colleages around the world and they don't have to setup anything. People can learn from what you have done because the code is right there! MyBinder has some problems though: it only works with languages that have a Jupyter kernel available. While there are kernels available for languages other than Python, Julia and R, outside those two your options are really limited especially in terms of visualisation. Also MyBinder has been getting slower due to large demands on a free service. The computations are being run on a remote server and one way or another, this costs money.

If you're willing to learn JavaScript, there is the option of writing [Observable notebooks](https://observablehq.com/). Observable is great, but it requires you to work in JavaScript. Also, to my best knowledge Observable is not (yet) open source, so you'll still be relying on an external service to work with your code.

Thirdly, you may not always want an interactive web environment to do your coding in. Coding is hard, and we got used to working with code, runtimes and debuggers from editors, consoles and IDEs. Why change all that? There is a solution where you can mix and match languages, write your story in one or more Markdown files, have your cake and eat it too! This setup is still under development, which is in part why I made this demo.

# The pendulum

It was found by Christiaan Huygens that a pendulum can make an excelent clock. We assume a solid massless rod suspending a weight of mass $m$ at a length $l$ from the origin. The Lagrangian for such a system (being $\mathcal{L} = T - U$, where $T$ is the kinetic energy and $U$ is the potential energy) is written as

$$\mathcal{L}(\theta, \dot{\theta}) = \frac{1}{2}ml^2\dot{\theta}^2 + mgl \cos\theta.$$

Using the Euler-Lagrange equations, in very terse notation $D_t \partial_{\dot{\theta}} \mathcal{L} = \partial_{\theta} \mathcal{L}$, leads to

$$\ddot{\theta} = -\frac{g}{l} \sin\theta.$$

This is a second order non-linear differential equation. To solve this numerically we write down the equation in phase-space using position $\vec{q}(t) = \theta(t)$ and momentum $\vec{p}(t) = D_{\dot{\theta}} \mathcal{L} = ml^2\dot{\theta}(t)$. This is best done using the Hamiltonian formalism. The Hamiltonian becomes

$$\mathcal{H} = \frac{\vec{p}^2}{2ml^2} - mgl \cos \vec{q}.$$

Having $\dot{\vec{p}} = - \partial_q \mathcal{H}$ and $\dot{\vec{q}} = + \partial_p \mathcal{H}$.

$$\begin{pmatrix}\dot{\vec{q}} \\ \dot{\vec{p}}\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}\vec{p} / {ml^2} \\ -mgl \sin \vec{q}\end{pmatrix}.$$

In PureScript this system can be expressed as follows:

``` {.pure #pendulum-model}
simplePendulum :: Number -> Number -> HamiltonianSystem Scalar
simplePendulum g l =
    { positionEquation: (\s -> (\p -> p / pow l 2.0) <$> s.momentum)
    , momentumEquation: (\s -> (\q -> -g * l * (sin q)) <$> s.position)
    }
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
The first line of this definition is the type declaration of the `simplePendulum` function: it takes a number (the gravitational accelleration) another number (the length of the pendulum) and returns a `HamiltonianSystem Scalar`, which is saying a Hamiltonian system of equations in one dimension. These types will be defined when we program the leap-frog integrator.
:::

We are now going to compute the time evolution of the single pendulum using the leap-frog method.

# Leap-frog method

We can describe this methods in terms of types in code. Later on, we will deal with systems of more than one dimension. To deal with this I assume the position and momentum vectors are stored in some `Apply` data structure. By doing this, I can write down the leap-frog integrator in generic terms. For the one-dimensional single pendulum, I have to wrap the `Number` into an `Apply` which I call `Scalar`.

``` {.pure #leap-frog}
newtype Scalar a = Scalar a

instance scalarFunctor :: Functor Scalar where
    map f (Scalar a) = Scalar (f a)

instance scalarApply :: Apply Scalar where
    apply (Scalar f) (Scalar a) = Scalar (f a)

instance scalarApplicative :: Applicative Scalar where
    pure a = Scalar a
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
A `Functor` is a type that can be mapped over. This mapping should hold to the `Functor` laws. It should preserve the identity function:

``` {.pure}
map id = id
```

and be linear over function composition

``` {.pure}
map (f <<< g) = map f <<< map g
```

An `Applicative` is a type allows for combining `Functors` over functions with `Functors` over arguments. Combined with curried function application this lets us `map` over functions of multiple arguments. This is explained better than I ever could in the ["Learn you a Haskell" book chapter on Functors, Applicatives and Monoids](http://learnyouahaskell.com/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids). Haskell and PureScript are similar enough for this reference to apply.
:::

We can describe the `State` of a system by giving `time`, `position` and `momentum`. Here `a` is the type-parameter that indicates the container type. For instance, the `position` member of a `State Scalar` will have type `Scalar Number`.

``` {.pure #leap-frog}
type State a =
    { time :: Number
    , position :: a Number
    , momentum :: a Number }
```

Then, a Hamiltonian system is given by two sets of first-order differential equations.

``` {.pure #leap-frog}
type HamiltonianSystem a =
    { positionEquation :: State a -> a Number
    , momentumEquation :: State a -> a Number }
```

And in general, a `Solver` for the Hamiltonian system takes a state object and returns a new state.

``` {.pure #leap-frog}
type Solver a = HamiltonianSystem a -> State a -> State a
```

The leap-frog method is a solver that uses a *kick* and *drift* phase. The *kick* phase integrates only the momentum part of the system,

``` {.pure #leap-frog}
kick :: forall f. (Apply f) 
    => Number -> HamiltonianSystem f -> State f -> State f
kick dt system state = state
    { momentum = (\p dp -> p + dt * dp)
               <$> state.momentum
               <*> system.momentumEquation state }
```

while the *drift* phase only integrates the position part.

``` {.pure #leap-frog}
drift :: forall f. (Apply f)
    => Number -> HamiltonianSystem f -> State f -> State f
drift dt system state = state
    { position = (\q dq -> q + dt * dq)
               <$> state.position
               <*> system.positionEquation state }
```

::: {.alert .alert-info}
Note that, for instance in the `drift` function, the operators `<$>` and `<*>` are our way of applying the lambda-function `(\q dq -> q + dt * dq)` to the `position` member of the state and the change in position given by the governing system of equations of motion. The `<$>` operator takes a function (of two arguments) and an applicative, call it a vector, and creates a vector of functions of one argument. Then the `<*>` operator applies the vector of functions to another vector of numbers. This way we can apply a function of $n$ arguments, point-wise to $n$ vectors, as long as these vectors are an instance of `Apply`.
:::

We add a *wait* phase to control the clock, in case we encounter time-dependent systems, and because we move the clock by `dt/2` after each *kick* or *drift*, which is specific to the leap-frog method.

``` {.pure #leap-frog}
wait :: forall a. Number -> State a -> State a
wait dt state = state
    { time = state.time + dt }
```

The leap-frog method follows a kick by a drift, with a separation of $dt/2$. We choose to start with a kick, then wait, drift, and wait again.

``` {.pure #leap-frog}
leapFrog :: forall f. (Apply f)
    => Number -> HamiltonianSystem f -> State f -> State f
leapFrog dt s = kick dt s >>> wait (dt/2.0) >>> drift dt s >>> wait (dt/2.0)
```

### Halting condition

``` {.pure #leap-frog}
type HaltingCondition a = State a -> State a -> Boolean

haltAtTime :: forall a. Number -> HaltingCondition a
haltAtTime t s1 s2 = s2.time >= t 
```

### Integration

``` {.pure #leap-frog}
iterateSolution :: forall a.
    (State a -> State a) -> HaltingCondition a -> State a -> State a
iterateSolution method halt init =
    let next = method init
    in if halt init next
        then next
        else iterateSolution method halt next

integrateSystem :: forall a.
    Solver a -> HaltingCondition a -> HamiltonianSystem a -> State a -> Array (State a)
integrateSystem solve halt f ic =
    let next = solve f ic
    in if halt ic next
        then ic : [next] :: Array (State a)
        else ic : integrateSystem solve halt f next
```

``` {.pure file=src/Hamilton.purs}

## Integrating the single pendulum

We had the following equations of motion,

Integrating this gives the time evolution of pendulum. We can compare it with the small-angle approximation. Here is a plot of the behaviour, you can change the initial angle with the slider.

# The double pendulum

The double pendulum is more complicated than the single one. We now have two angles $\theta$ and $\varphi$, two lengths $k$ and $l$, and two masses $m$ and $n$. The potential energy is

$$U(\theta, \varphi) = - m g k \cos{\theta} - n g (k \cos{\theta} + l \cos{\varphi}),$$

and the kinetic energy (takes a bit of calculating),

$$T(\theta, \varphi, \dot{\theta}, \dot{\varphi}) = \frac{1}{2} m k^2 \dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2} n \left(\dot{\theta}^2 k^2 + \dot{\varphi}^2 l^2 + 2\dot{\theta}\dot{\varphi}kl \cos(\theta - \varphi)\right).$$

``` {.pure #double-pendulum}
type DoublePendulum =
        { l1 :: Number
        , m1 :: Number
        , l2 :: Number
        , m2 :: Number
        , g  :: Number }
```

We describe the pendulum in terms of the coordinates $\theta$ and $\varphi$. Just as we did for the `Scalar` type, we need to define how to map over the `Coordinates` type, meaning we have to create an `Applicative` instance.

``` {.pure #double-pendulum}
newtype Coordinates a = Coordinates
        { theta :: a
        , phi   :: a }

instance functorCoordinates :: Functor Coordinates where
    map f (Coordinates { theta, phi }) =
        Coordinates { theta: f theta, phi: f phi }

instance applyCoordinates :: Apply Coordinates where
    apply (Coordinates { theta: fTheta, phi: fPhi })
          (Coordinates { theta, phi }) =
        Coordinates { theta: fTheta theta, phi: fPhi phi }

instance applicativeCoordinates :: Applicative Coordinates where
    pure a = Coordinates { theta: a, phi: a }

instance showCoordinates :: Show a => Show (Coordinates a) where
    show (Coordinates x) = show x
```

We choose the position vector $\vec{q} = (\theta, \varphi)$, then the canonical momentum is $\vec{p} = \partial_{\dot{\vec{q}}} \mathcal{L}$. This gives the terrible momentum vector,

$$\vec{p} = \begin{pmatrix}
mk^2\dot{\theta} + nk^2\dot{\theta} + nkl \dot{\varphi} \cos(\theta - \varphi)\\
nl^2\dot{\varphi} + nkl \dot{\theta} \cos(\theta - \varphi)
\end{pmatrix}.$$

We need to write the Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$ in terms of $\vec{q}$ and $\vec{p}$. This is possible. I stole and rewrote this derivation from [Diego Assencio's blog](https://diego.assencio.com/?index=e5ac36fcb129ce95a61f8e8ce0572dbf).

We can rewrite our expression for $\vec{p}$ in a matrix-vector form,

$$\vec{p} = B \dot{\vec{q}},$$

where

$$B = \begin{pmatrix}
(m + n)k^2 && nkl \cos(\theta - \varphi)\\ nkl \cos(\theta - \varphi) && nl^2
\end{pmatrix}.$$

Then we can write the velocities $\dot{\vec{q}} = B^{-1} \vec{p}$. The inverse of a $2\times2$ symmetric matrix is given by

$$B^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}
a && c \\ c && b\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \frac{1}{ab - c^2} \begin{pmatrix} b && -c \\ -c && a
\end{pmatrix}.$$

We will write $$D = \det B = nk^2l^2 \left(m + n \sin^2(\theta - \varphi)\right).$$ From this expression for the determinant it is clear that $D \ge nmk^2l^2$, and that the inverse $B^{-1}$ exists.

Now it is helpful to write $T(\theta, \varphi, \dot{\theta}, \dot{\varphi})$ in terms of $a, b, c$ and $d$,

$$T = \frac{1}{2}\left(a\dot{\theta}^2 + b\dot{\varphi} + 2c\dot{\theta}\dot{\varphi}\right).$$

Inserting $\dot{\theta} = (p_{\theta}b - p_{\varphi}c)/D$ and $\dot{\varphi} = (p_{\varphi}a - p_{\varphi}c)/D$, things magically work out (making me feel I did too much work) and we get,

$$T = \frac{bp_{\theta}^2 + ap_{\varphi}^2 - 2cp_{\theta}p_{\varphi}}{2D},$$

``` {.pure #double-pendulum}
kineticEnergy :: DoublePendulum -> Coordinates Number -> Coordinates Number -> Number
kineticEnergy z (Coordinates q) (Coordinates p) =
    (b * (pow p.theta 2.0) + a * (pow p.phi 2.0) - 2.0 * c * p.theta * p.phi) / (2.0 * det)
    where a = (z.m1 + z.m2) * (pow z.l1 2.0)
          b = z.m2 * (pow z.l2 2.0)
          c = z.m2 * z.l1 * z.l2 * (cos $ q.theta - q.phi)
          det = a * b - c * c
```

and the Hamiltonian becomes

$$\mathcal{H} = \frac
{nl^2 p_{\theta}^2 + (m + n)k^2 p_{\varphi}^2 - 2nkl p_{\theta} p_{\varphi} \cos(\theta - \varphi)}
{2nk^2l^2 \left(m + n \sin^2(\theta - \varphi)\right)}
- (m + n)gk \cos{\theta} - ngl \cos{\varphi}.$$

Now we get the Hamilton equations of motion, $\dot{\vec{p}} = - \partial_q \mathcal{H}$ and $\dot{\vec{q}} = + \partial_p \mathcal{H}$,

$$\begin{align}
\dot{\theta} = \partial_{p_{\theta}} \mathcal{H} =& \frac{nl}{D} \left(l p_{\theta} - k\cos(\theta - \varphi) p_{\varphi}\right),\\
\dot{\varphi} = \partial_{p_{\varphi}} \mathcal{H} =& \frac{k}{D} \left((m+n)k p_{\varphi} - nl\cos(\theta - \varphi) p_{\theta}\right),\\
\dot{p}_{\theta} = -\partial_{\theta} \mathcal{H} =&\xi - (m+n)gk \sin \theta,\\
\dot{p}_{\varphi} = -\partial_{\varphi} \mathcal{H} =& -\xi - ngl \sin \varphi,
\end{align}$$

where 

$$\xi = \frac{nkl}{2D}\left(T\ nkl\sin(2(\theta - \varphi)) - 2\sin(\theta - \varphi) p_{\theta} p_{\varphi}\right).$$

``` {.pure #double-pendulum}

          mu q  = cos $ q.theta - q.phi

                    b = z.m2 * (pow z.l2 2.0)
                    c = z.m2 * z.l1 * z.l2 * (mu q)
```

Terrible indeed. It is amazing how quickly the addition of another pendulum to the system just explodes in your face. Since we have a `HamiltonianSystem` defined for the double pendulum, integration of this system is the same as integrating the single pendulum. The next section describes how I made the animation at the top of this page.

# Animation using Flare

We have an animation canvas and a button that controls if the animation plays or not. The `Model` is as follows:

``` {.pure #double-pendulum-animation}
type Model =
    { state       :: State Coordinates
    , params      :: DoublePendulum
    , currentTime :: Number
    , timeStep    :: Number
    , playing     :: Boolean }
```

The model is updated by passing messages to an `update` function.

``` {.pure #double-pendulum-animation}
data Msg =
      AnimationFrame Number
    | TogglePlay
    | None
```

Updating the model:

``` {.pure #double-pendulum-animation}
forwardModel :: Number -> Model -> Model
forwardModel dt m = m { state = moduloState newState
                      , currentTime = newTime }
    where newState = iterateSolution
            (leapFrog m.timeStep (doublePendulum m.params))
            (haltAtTime $ m.state.time + dt)
            m.state
          newTime = m.currentTime + newState.time - m.state.time

moduloState :: State Coordinates -> State Coordinates
moduloState s@{ position: Coordinates { theta, phi } } =
    s { position = Coordinates { theta: theta % (2.0*pi)
                               , phi: phi % (2.0*pi) } }

update :: Msg -> Model -> Model
update (AnimationFrame t) m = if (t / 1000.0 - m.currentTime) > m.timeStep
    then if m.playing
         then forwardModel (t / 1000.0 - m.currentTime) m
         else m { currentTime = t / 1000.0 }
    else m
update TogglePlay m = m { playing = not m.playing }
update None m = m
```

And we use the following initial state:

## Flare

Using `Flare` we can create a set of UI controls that generate a stream of messages. The `events` function takes a `Signal Number` argument that generates a signal for every animation frame.

``` {.pure #double-pendulum-flare}
events :: Signal.Signal Number -> Flare.UI Msg
events time = Flare.liftSF (Signal.merge $ AnimationFrame <$> time)
                           (Flare.button "Play/Pause" None TogglePlay)
```

In the `main` function we can obtain the animation signal, and pass it to `events`. Using `Flare.foldp` the series of `Msg` messages is converted into a series of `Model` objects. These are then rendered to a canvas in the `draw` function.

``` {.pure #double-pendulum-flare}
main :: Effect Unit
main = do
    time <- animationFrame
    let model = Flare.foldp update initModel (events time)
    runFlareDrawing "double-pendulum-control" 
                    "double-pendulum-output"
                    (draw <$> model)
```

## Drawing

``` {.pure #double-pendulum-flare}
draw :: Model -> Drawing.Drawing
draw { state:  { position: Coordinates q }
     , params: { l1, l2, m1, m2 } } =
    let p1    = { x: l1 * (sin q.theta), y: l1 * (cos q.theta) }
        p2    = { x: p1.x + l2 * (sin q.phi), y: p1.y + l2 * (cos q.phi) }
        orig  = { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }
        tr {x, y} = { x: x*100.0 + 300.0, y: y*100.0 + 100.0 }
        rods  = Drawing.outlined 
                    (Drawing.lineWidth 2.0 <> Drawing.outlineColor (rgb' 0.0 0.0 0.0))
                    (Drawing.path $ map tr [orig, p1, p2])
        hinge = Drawing.filled
                    (Drawing.fillColor (rgb' 0.0 0.0 0.0))
                    (Drawing.circle (tr orig).x (tr orig).y 3.0)
        mass1 = Drawing.filled
                    (Drawing.fillColor (rgb' 0.5 0.0 0.0))
                    (Drawing.circle (tr p1).x (tr p1).y (m1 * 4.0))
        mass2 = Drawing.filled
                    (Drawing.fillColor (rgb' 0.5 0.0 0.0))
                    (Drawing.circle (tr p2).x (tr p2).y (m2 * 4.0))
    in Drawing.shadow (Drawing.shadowOffset 2.0 2.0 <> Drawing.shadowBlur 4.0 <> Drawing.shadowColor (rgb' 0.5 0.5 0.5))
                      (rods <> hinge <> mass1 <> mass2)
